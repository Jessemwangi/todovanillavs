# Pure TypeScript Todo App
This is a simple todo application built using TypeScript and deployed on Render. The app allows users to create, delete, mark as done, and modify todos. It was developed as part of a business school Helsinki project and is the first sprint of the project.

## Technologies Used

**TypeScript**: a typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors at compile-time


**CSS**: used for styling the app
**HTML**: used for structuring the app
**Webpack**: a bundler that helps package the app's code and assets for deployment
**Render**: a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage web applications

## Getting Started
To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm run start`

This will start the app on your local machine at http://localhost:3000.

## Next Sprint
In the next sprint, we plan to add a database connection to the app to persist the todos between sessions.
