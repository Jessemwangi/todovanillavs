# TypeScript Todo Application with Drag and Drop
This TypeScript-based Todo Application is a personal project that showcases the power of TypeScript and the usage of the drag and drop package. With this application, users can create, delete, mark as done, and modify their todos with ease. TypeScript helps minimize errors during development, making it an ideal language to use for building reliable and scalable applications. This project serves as a great introduction to TypeScript, allowing developers to learn more about its capabilities and how it can be used to build complex applications. If you're looking to learn more about TypeScript and how it can be used in your development projects, this Todo Application is a great place to start!.

## Technologies Used

**TypeScript**: a typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors at compile-time


**CSS**: used for styling the app
**HTML**: used for structuring the app
**Webpack**: a bundler that helps package the app's code and assets for deployment
**Render**: a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage web applications

## Getting Started
To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm run start`

This will start the app on your local machine at http://localhost:3000.

## Next Sprint
In the next sprint, we plan to add a database connection to the app to persist the todos between sessions.
